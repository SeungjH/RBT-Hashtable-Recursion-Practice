ML Steps
1. the problem
2. data collection
3. data cleaning
4. data selection (selecting relative data for our model)
5. pick a model
6. train model
7. test model
8. improve model by repeatedly training


getting started:
1. learn the basics of the language
2. learn basic ML algo
    -linear regression
    -KNN (K-Nearest_Neighbours)
    -SVM(Support Vector Machines)
3. learn what interests you
    -reinforcement learning
    -neural networks
    -computer vision
